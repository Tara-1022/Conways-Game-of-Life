                Conway's Game of Life
            </h1>
            <br>
            In 1968, John Conway, a brilliant English Mathematician, invented a new 'game' using
            pieces of a Go board. This was not by accident; he was inspired by Von Neumann's work on cellular
            automata, and
            was playing around with different automata rules in an attempt to create a 'universal', two-dimensional
            cellular automaton.
            <br><br>
            These are infinite grids of cells, with certain rules applied to how they evolve.
            <br><br>
            It doesn't have to be complicated.<br>
            All you really have to do is create patterns and click 'Animate'. You could also load a pattern by choosing from the drop-down menu. If you're looking
            for more, there's an entire repository of interesting patterns over at 
            <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Glider#:~:text=Conway%20christened%20this%20walking%20piece,but%20it%20has%20glided%20diagonally">LifeWiki</a>.
            <br><br>
            A tweak - you're allowed to meddle with cells while the universe evolves (just because it's fun).
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>
             could best be descibed as a recreational mathematical game.<br>
            Perhaps not in the usual sense - this is a zero-player game, which means that you're only responsible
            for setting up the initial state of the universe.
            <br>
            <br>
            The rules?
            <ul>
                <li> - A live cell dies if it has less than 2 live neighbours</li>
                <li> - A live cell stays alive if it has 2 or 3 live neighbours</li>
                <li> - A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes alive</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Of course, in our board, the live cells are yellow and the dead ones black. These rules, when applied to any
            given state, create a new state of the universe. It's quite allegorical to births and deaths of regular
            living cells!
            <br><br>
            Interestingly, cellular automata following Conway's rules are Turing Complete. This means that you could simulate any computer using the Game of Life
            - as long as you're willing to sacrifice speed, efficiency and practicality.

            The Game of Life is a phenomenon that you can come across and create almost anywhere, and with anything - from <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/conways-game-of-life-in-google-docs/"> docs</a> to
